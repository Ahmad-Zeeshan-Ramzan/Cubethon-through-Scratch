# Cubethon

## Overview:
Cubethon is an exciting obstacle game featuring two engaging modes: Level Base Mode and Runner Mode. Players navigate through dynamic obstacles, with the game ending upon collision or falling from the path. Built entirely from scratch using Unity and C#, Cubethon offers a thrilling gaming experience that challenges players' reflexes and strategic thinking.

## Modes:

**Level Base Mode:** Players progress through increasingly challenging levels, each with unique obstacles and layouts. The goal is to reach the end of each level without colliding or falling off the path.
**Runner Mode:** In this endless mode, players must survive as long as possible while the obstacles become progressively more difficult. The game ends upon collision or falling from the path.

## Credits:
This project was created with inspiration from tutorials by Brackeys on YouTube. However, Cubethon was built entirely from scratch, showcasing my skills in game development using Unity and C#.
